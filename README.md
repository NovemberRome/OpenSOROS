OpenSOROS is a project to aggregate, analyze, visualize, and explain new types of discourse occurring on social media. The project seeks to learn about the factions duking it out in a political battleground which spans across countries, social media platforms, and languages. Its guided by questions like:
     
How does belief in conspiracy theories vary with other political beliefs?
    
If we got big enough, could we *actually get George Soros to fund this thing*?
    
How do politicians differentiate themselves on social media? 
    
Can we get a clearer picture of purposefully ambiguous political movements like the alt-right? Can we uncover strong links in content between outright nazis and more socially acceptable right-wing personalities? What makes something 'beyond the pale'?

   
To answer (and refine, and expand on) these questions, OpenSOROS needs volunteers - specifically people interested in:


1. politics! (duh)    
    
2. memes
  
3. Storytelling
   
4. analytics including:
   
- data mining
   
- machine learning
   
- natural language processing
   
- social network analysis
    
5. Graphic Design ( as evidenced by our current working logo)
   
6. Web Development   
    
6. ?????
