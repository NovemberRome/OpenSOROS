OpenSOROS is a project to aggregate, analyze, visualize, and explain new types of discourse occurring on social media, from the bowels of 4chan, to the meme pages of leftbook, to the subreddits of the alt-right. The project seeks to learn about the factions duking it out in this political battleground which spans across countries, social media platforms, and languages. Its guided by questions like:
     
How does belief in conspiracy theories vary with other political beliefs?
    
If we got big enough, could we *actually get George Soros to fund this thing*?
    
How do the memes and the shitposts shape the discourse? What kinds of memes are characteristic of specific factions, what kinds of memes have a broad appeal?
    
Can we get a clearer picture of purposefully ambiguous political movements like the alt-right? Can we uncover strong links in content between outright nazis and more socially acceptable right-wing personalities? What makes something 'beyond the pale'?

   
To answer (and refine, and expand on) these questions, OpenSOROS needs volunteers - specifically people interested in:


1. politics! (duh)    
    
2. memes and shitposts
  
3. Storytelling
   
4. analytics including:
   
- data mining
   
- machine learning
   
- natural language processing
   
- social network analysis
    
5. Graphic Design ( as evidenced by our current working logo)
   
6. Web Development   
    
6. ?????
